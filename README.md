# ChampionsLeague
Windows Forms application for recording teams' results and players' statistics in a group based competition. 

The application is realized through an MVC pattern and uses NHibernate service for storing and manipulating data. Upon starting, the program will automatically fill up the database with small amount of data, only to present basic functionalities, so that the user can get some intuition about how the program works. Users can also read the PDF file more information on how to get the most of the app.
